  abstract  = "The Hawaiian monk seal (HMS) is the single extant species of
               tropical earless seals of the genus Neomonachus. The species
               survived a severe bottleneck in the late 19th century and
               experienced subsequent population declines until becoming the
               subject of a NOAA-led species recovery effort beginning in 1976
               when the population was fewer than 1000 animals. Like other
               recovering species, the Hawaiian monk seal has been reported to
               have reduced genetic heterogeneity due to the bottleneck and
               subsequent inbreeding. Here, we report a chromosomal reference
               assembly for a male animal produced using a variety of methods.
               The final assembly consisted of 16 autosomes, an X, and portions
               of the Y chromosomes. We compared variants in this animal to
               other HMS and to a frequently sequenced human sample, confirming
               about 12\% of the variation seen in man. To confirm that the
               reference animal was representative of the HMS, we compared his
               sequence to that of 10 other individuals and noted similarly low
               variation in all. Variation in the major histocompatibility
               (MHC) genes was nearly absent compared to the orthologous human
               loci. Demographic analysis predicts that Hawaiian monk seals
               have had a long history of small populations preceding the
               bottleneck, and their current low levels of heterozygosity may
               indicate specialization to a stable environment. When we
               compared our reference assembly to that of other species, we
               observed significant conservation of chromosomal architecture
               with other pinnipeds, especially other phocids. This reference
               should be a useful tool for future evolutionary studies as well

              the libraries generated by these varying approaches is
              challenging and researchers lack a common framework for defining

              pooled (typically via a selection assay) or isolate (often
              referred to as screening) phenotyping approaches. We approach
              this from the context of creating massively parallel, precisely

              important pest in the olive fruit agribusiness industry. This is
              because female flies lay their eggs in the unripe fruits and upon
              hatching the larvae feed on the fruits thus destroying them. The
              lack of a high-quality genome and other genomic and
              transcriptomic data has hindered progress in understanding the
              fly's biology and proposing alternative control methods to
              pesticide use. RESULTS: Genomic DNA was sequenced from male and
              female Demokritos strain flies, maintained in the laboratory for
              over 45 years. We used short-, mate-pair-, and long-read
              sequencing technologies to generate a combined male-female genome
              assembly (GenBank accession GCA\_001188975.2). Genomic DNA
              sequencing from male insects using 10x Genomics linked-reads
              technology followed by mate-pair and long-read scaffolding and
              gap-closing generated a highly contiguous 489 Mb genome with a
              scaffold N50 of 4.69 Mb and L50 of 30 scaffolds (GenBank

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Three-dimensional spatial organization of chromosomes
              is defined by highly self-interacting regions 0.1-1 Mb in size
              termed Topological Associating Domains (TADs). Genetic factors
              that explain dynamic variation in TAD structure are not
              understood. We hypothesize that common structural variation (SV)
              in the human population can disrupt regulatory sequences and
              thereby influence TAD formation. To determine the effects of SVs
              on 3D chromatin organization, we performed chromosome
              conformation capture sequencing (Hi-C) of lymphoblastoid cell
              lines from 19 subjects for which SVs had been previously
              characterized in the 1000 genomes project. We tested the effects
              of common deletion polymorphisms on TAD structure by linear
              regression analysis of nearby quantitative chromatin interactions
              (contacts) within 240 kb of the deletion, and we specifically
              tested the hypothesis that deletions at TAD boundaries (TBs)
              could result in large-scale alterations in chromatin
              conformation. RESULTS: Large (> 10 kb) deletions had significant
              effects on long-range chromatin interactions. Deletions were
              associated with increased contacts that span the deleted region
              and this effect was driven by large deletions that were not
              located within a TAD boundary (nonTB). Some deletions at TBs,
              including a 80 kb deletion of the genes CFHR1 and CFHR3, had
              detectable effects on chromatin contacts. However for TB
              deletions overall, we did not detect a pattern of effects that
              was consistent in magnitude or direction. Large inversions in the
              population had a distinguishable signature characterized by a
              rearrangement of contacts that span its breakpoints. CONCLUSIONS:
              Our study demonstrates that common SVs in the population impact
              long-range chromatin structure, and deletions and inversions have
              distinct signatures. However, the effects that we observe are
              subtle and variable between loci. Genome-wide analysis of
              chromatin conformation in large cohorts will be needed to
              quantify the influence of common SVs on chromatin structure.",

              substantial proportions of mammalian sex chromosomes, often
              contain genes, and have high rates of structural variation
              arising via ectopic recombination. As a result, they underlie
              many genomic disorders. Maintenance of the palindromic structure
              by gene conversion between the arms has been documented, but over
              longer time periods, palindromes are remarkably labile.
              Mechanisms of origin and loss of palindromes have, however,
              received little attention. RESULTS: Here, we use fiber-FISH, 10x
              Genomics Linked-Read sequencing, and breakpoint PCR sequencing to
              characterize the structural variation of the P8 palindrome on the
              human Y chromosome, which contains two copies of the VCY
              (Variable Charge Y) gene. We find a deletion of almost an entire
              arm of the palindrome, leading to death of the palindrome, a size
              increase by recruitment of adjacent sequence, and other complex
              changes including the formation of an entire new palindrome
              nearby. Together, these changes are found in ~ 1\% of men, and we
              can assign likely molecular mechanisms to these mutational
              events. As a result, healthy men can have 1-4 copies of VCY.
              CONCLUSIONS: Gross changes, especially duplications, in
              palindrome structure can be relatively frequent and facilitate
              the evolution of sex chromosomes in humans, and potentially also
              in other mammalian species.",

              largely been uncovered using short-read whole-genome sequencing.
              However, these short-read approaches fail to give a complete
              picture of a genome. They struggle to identify structural events,
              cannot access repetitive regions, and fail to resolve the human
              genome into haplotypes. Here, we describe an approach that
              retains long range information while maintaining the advantages
              of short reads. Starting from ∼1 ng of high molecular weight DNA,
              we produce barcoded short-read libraries. Novel informatic
              approaches allow for the barcoded short reads to be associated
              with their original long molecules producing a novel data type
              known as ``Linked-Reads''. This approach allows for simultaneous
              detection of small and large variants from a single library. In
              this manuscript, we show the advantages of Linked-Reads over
              standard short-read approaches for reference-based analysis.
              Linked-Reads allow mapping to 38 Mb of sequence not accessible to
              short reads, adding sequence in 423 difficult-to-sequence genes

              Linked-Read whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing identify
              complex structural variations, including balanced events and
              single exon deletions and duplications. Further, Linked-Reads
              extend the region of high-confidence calls by 68.9 Mb. The data

                 obscure interclonal differences. Single-cell RNA-sequencing
                 has revealed transcriptional heterogeneity within a variety of
                 tumor types, but it is unclear how this expression
                 heterogeneity relates to subclonal genetic events -- for

                 mutationally defined
                 subclones[3][3],[4][4],[5][5],[6][6]-[9][7]. To address this
                 question, we developed an approach that integrates enhanced
                 whole genome sequencing (eWGS) with the 10x Genomics Chromium
                 Single Cell 5' Gene Expression workflow (scRNA-seq) to
                 directly link expressed mutations with transcriptional
                 profiles at single cell resolution. Using bone marrow samples
                 from five cases of primary human Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML),
                 we generated WGS and scRNA-seq data for each case. Duplicate
                 single cell libraries representing a median of 20,474 cells
                 per case were generated from the bone marrow of each patient.
                 Although the libraries were 5' biased, we detected expressed
                 mutations in cDNAs at distances up to 10 kbp from the 5' ends
                 of well-expressed genes, allowing us to identify hundreds to
                 thousands of cells with AML-specific somatic mutations in
                 every case. This data made it possible to distinguish AML
                 cells (including normal-karyotype AML cells) from surrounding
                 normal cells, to study tumor differentiation and intratumoral
                 expression heterogeneity, to identify expression signatures
                 associated with subclonal mutations, and to find cell surface
                 markers that could be used to purify subclones for further
                 study. The data also revealed transcriptional heterogeneity
                 that occurred independently of subclonal mutations, suggesting
                 that additional factors drive epigenetic heterogeneity. This

                 successfully forde novoassembly of human genomes, however, the
                 utility of this technology for complex plant genomes is
                 unproven. We evaluated the technology for this purpose by
                 sequencing the 3.5-gigabase (Gb) diploid pepper (Capsicum
                 annuum) genome with a single Linked-Read library. Plant
                 genomes, including pepper, are characterized by long, highly
                 similar repetitive sequences. Accordingly, significant effort
                 is used to ensure that the sequenced plant is highly
                 homozygous and the resulting assembly is a haploid consensus.
                 With a phased assembly approach, we targeted a heterozygous
                 F1derived from a wide cross to assess the ability to derive
                 both haplotypes and characterize a pungency gene with a large
                 insertion/deletion. The Supernova software generated a highly
                 ordered, more contiguous sequence assembly than all currently
                 availableC. annuumreference genomes. Over 83\% of the final
                 assembly was anchored and oriented using four publicly
                 available de novolinkage maps. A comparison of the annotation
                 of conserved eukaryotic genes indicated the completeness of
                 assembly. The validity of the phased assembly is further
                 demonstrated with the complete recovery of both 2.5-Kb
                 insertion/deletion haplotypes of thePUN1locus in the F1sample

                 nearly full recovery of the BUSCO2 gene set within each of the
                 two haplotypes. The most contiguous pepper genome assembly to
                 date has been generated which demonstrates that Linked-Read

                 contributors to disease, yet they remain one of the most
                 difficult types of variation to accurately ascertain, in part
                 because they tend to cluster in duplicated and repetitive
                 regions, but also because the various signals for these events
                 can be challenging to detect with short reads. Clinically,
                 aCGH and karyotype remain the most commonly used assays for
                 genome-wide structural variant (SV) detection, though there is
                 clear potential benefit to an NGS-based assay that accurately
                 detects both SVs and single nucleotide variants. Linked-Read
                 sequencing is a relatively simple, fast, and cost-effective
                 method that is applicable to both genome and targeted assays.
                 Linked-Reads are generated by performing haplotype-level
                 dilution of long input DNA molecules into >1 million barcoded
                 partitions, generating barcoded short reads within those
                 partitions, and then performing short read sequencing in bulk.
                 We performed 30x Linked-Read genome sequencing on a set of 23
                 samples with known balanced or unbalanced SVs. Twenty-seven of
                 the 29 known events were detected and another event was called
                 as a candidate. Sequence downsampling was performed on a
                 subset to determine the lowest sequence depth required to
                 detect variations. Copy-number variants can be called with as
                 little as 1-2x sequencing depth (5-10Gb) while balanced events
                 require on the order of 10x coverage for variant calls to be
                 made, although specific signal is clearly present at 1-2x
                 sequencing depth. In addition to detecting a full spectrum of
                 variant types with a single test, Linked-Read sequencing
                 provides base-level resolution of breakpoints, enabling

                 course of clinical next-generation sequence analysis for
                 diagnosing human heritable conditions. The specifications for
                 variant files were initially developed to be flexible with
                 regard to content representation to support a variety of
                 research applications. This flexibility permits variation with
                 regard to how sequence findings are described and this
                 depends, in part, on the conventions used. For clinical
                 laboratory testing, this poses a problem because these

                 yet fundamental to understanding its biology. Over the past
                 decade, thousands of human genomes have been sequenced,
                 contributing deeply to biomedical research. In the vast
                 majority of cases, these have been analyzed by aligning
                 sequence reads to a single reference genome, biasing the
                 resulting analyses, and in general, failing to capture
                 sequences novel to a given genome. Some de novo assemblies
                 have been constructed free of reference bias, but nearly all
                 were constructed by merging homologous loci into single
                 ``consensus'' sequences, generally absent from nature. These
                 assemblies do not correctly represent the diploid biology of
                 an individual. In exactly two cases, true diploid de novo
                 assemblies have been made, at great expense. One was generated
                 using Sanger sequencing, and one using thousands of clone
                 pools. Here, we demonstrate a straightforward and low-cost
                 method for creating true diploid de novo assemblies. We make a
                 single library from ∼1 ng of high molecular weight DNA, using
                 the 10x Genomics microfluidic platform to partition the
                 genome. We applied this technique to seven human samples,
                 generating low-cost HiSeq X data, then assembled these using a
                 new ``pushbutton'' algorithm, Supernova. Each computation took
                 2 d on a single server. Each yielded contigs longer than 100
                 kb, phase blocks longer than 2.5 Mb, and scaffolds longer than
                 15 Mb. Our method provides a scalable capability for
                 determining the actual diploid genome sequence in a sample,

                 GRCh38 is the first coordinate-changing assembly update since
                 2009; it reflects the resolution of roughly 1000 issues and
                 encompasses modifications ranging from thousands of single
                 base changes to megabase-scale path reorganizations, gap
                 closures, and localization of previously orphaned sequences.
                 We developed a new approach to sequence generation for
                 targeted base updates and used data from new genome mapping
                 technologies and single haplotype resources to identify and
                 resolve larger assembly issues. For the first time, the
                 reference assembly contains sequence-based representations for
                 the centromeres. We also expanded the number of alternate loci
                 to create a reference that provides a more robust
                 representation of human population variation. We demonstrate
                 that the updates render the reference an improved annotation

                 impact variant interpretation at clinically relevant loci. We
                 additionally evaluated a collection of new de novo long-read
                 haploid assemblies and conclude that although the new
                 assemblies compare favorably to the reference with respect to
                 continuity, error rate, and gene completeness, the reference
                 still provides the best representation for complex genomic
                 regions and coding sequences. We assert that the collected
                 updates in GRCh38 make the newer assembly a more robust
                 substrate for comprehensive analyses that will promote our

                 Supernova v1.1 software produced scaffolds with an N50 of

                 Mbp. These results were 161X and 215X, respectively, improved
                 over DISCOVAR de novo assemblies. The quality of the scaffolds

                 robust identification and reporting of variant-level
                 information in relation to disease. With the shift to
                 high-throughput sequencing, a major challenge for clinical
                 diagnostics is the cross-identification of variants called on
                 their genomic position to resources that rely on transcript-
                 or protein-based descriptions. METHODS: We evaluated the
                 accuracy of three tools (SnpEff, Variant Effect Predictor, and
                 Variation Reporter) that generate transcript and protein-based
                 variant nomenclature from genomic coordinates according to
                 guidelines by the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS). Our
                 evaluation was based on transcript-controlled comparisons to a
                 manually curated set of 126 test variants of various types
                 drawn from data sources, each with HGVS-compliant transcript
                 and protein descriptors. We further evaluated the concordance
                 between annotations generated by Snpeff and Variant Effect
                 Predictor and those in major germline and cancer databases:
                 ClinVar and COSMIC, respectively. RESULTS: We find that there
                 is substantial discordance between the annotation tools and
                 databases in the description of insertions and/or deletions.
                 Using our ground truth set of variants, constructed
                 specifically to identify challenging events, accuracy was
                 between 80 and 90\% for coding and 50 and 70\% for protein
                 changes for 114 to 126 variants. Exact concordance for SNV
                 syntax was over 99.5\% between ClinVar and Variant Effect
                 Predictor and SnpEff, but less than 90\% for non-SNV variants.
                 For COSMIC, exact concordance for coding and protein SNVs was
                 between 65 and 88\% and less than 15\% for insertions. Across
                 the tools and datasets, there was a wide range of different
                 but equivalent expressions describing protein variants.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal significant inconsistency in
                 variant representation across tools and databases. While some
                 of these syntax differences may be clear to a clinician, they
                 can confound variant matching, an important step in variant
                 classification. These results highlight the urgent need for
                 the adoption and adherence to uniform standards in variant
                 annotation, with consistent reporting on the genomic
                 reference, to enable accurate and efficient data-driven

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: The last two human genome assemblies have extended
                 the previous linear golden-path paradigm of the human genome
                 to a graph-like model to better represent regions with a high
                 degree of structural variability. The new model offers
                 opportunities to improve the technical validity of variant
                 calling in whole-genome sequencing (WGS). METHODS: We
                 developed an algorithm that analyzes the patterns of variant
                 calls in the 178 structurally variable regions of the GRCh38
                 genome assembly, and infers whether a given sample is most
                 likely to contain sequences from the primary assembly, an
                 alternate locus, or their heterozygous combination at each of
                 these 178 regions. We investigate 121 in-house WGS datasets
                 that have been aligned to the GRCh37 and GRCh38 assemblies.
                 RESULTS: We show that stretches of sequences that are largely
                 but not entirely identical between the primary assembly and an
                 alternate locus can result in multiple variant calls against
                 regions of the primary assembly. In WGS analysis, this results
                 in characteristic and recognizable patterns of variant calls
                 at positions that we term alignable scaffold-discrepant
                 positions (ASDPs). In 121 in-house genomes, on average
                 51.8$\pm$3.8 of the 178 regions were found to correspond best
                 to an alternate locus rather than the primary assembly
                 sequence, and filtering these genomes with our algorithm led
                 to the identification of 7863 variant calls per genome that
                 colocalized with ASDPs. Additionally, we found that 437 of 791
                 genome-wide association study hits located within one of the
                 regions corresponded to ASDPs. CONCLUSIONS: Our algorithm uses
                 the information contained in the 178 structurally variable
                 regions of the GRCh38 genome assembly to avoid spurious
                 variant calls in cases where samples contain an alternate
                 locus rather than the corresponding segment of the primary
                 assembly. These results suggest the great potential of fully
                 incorporating the resources of graph-like genome assemblies
                 into variant calling, but also underscore the importance of
                 developing computational resources that will allow a full
                 reconstruction of the genotype in personal genomes. Our

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Whole exome sequencing is increasingly used for the
               clinical evaluation of genetic disease, yet the variation of
               coverage and sensitivity over medically relevant parts of the
               genome remains poorly understood. Several sequencing-based
               assays continue to provide coverage that is inadequate for
               clinical assessment. METHODS: Using sequence data obtained from
               the NA12878 reference sample and pre-defined lists of
               medically-relevant protein-coding and noncoding sequences, we
               compared the breadth and depth of coverage obtained among four
               commercial exome capture platforms and whole genome sequencing.
               In addition, we evaluated the performance of an augmented exome
               strategy, ACE, that extends coverage in medically relevant
               regions and enhances coverage in areas that are challenging to
               sequence. Leveraging reference call-sets, we also examined the
               effects of improved coverage on variant detection sensitivity.
               RESULTS: We observed coverage shortfalls with each of the
               conventional exome-capture and whole-genome platforms across
               several medically interpretable genes. These gaps included areas
               of the genome required for reporting recently established
               secondary findings (ACMG) and known disease-associated loci. The
               augmented exome strategy recovered many of these gaps, resulting
               in improved coverage in these areas. At clinically-relevant
               coverage levels (100 \% bases covered at $\geq$20$\times$), ACE
               improved coverage among genes in the medically interpretable
               genome (>90 \% covered relative to 10-78 \% with other
               platforms), the set of ACMG secondary finding genes (91 \%
               covered relative to 4-75 \% with other platforms) and a subset
               of variants known to be associated with human disease (99 \%
               covered relative to 52-95 \% with other platforms). Improved
               coverage translated into improvements in sensitivity, with ACE
               variant detection sensitivities (>97.5 \% SNVs, >92.5 \% InDels)
               exceeding that observed with conventional whole-exome and
               whole-genome platforms. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should consider
               analytical performance when making clinical assessments, given
               that even a few missed variants can lead to reporting false
               negative results. An augmented exome strategy provides a level
               of coverage not achievable with other platforms, thus addressing
               concerns regarding the lack of sensitivity in clinically
               important regions. In clinical applications where comprehensive
               coverage of medically interpretable areas of the genome requires
               higher localized sequencing depth, an augmented exome approach
               offers both cost and performance advantages over other
               sequencing-based tests.",

  abstract    = "A complete reference assembly is essential for accurately
                 interpreting individual genomes and associating variation with
                 phenotypes. While the current human reference genome sequence
                 is of very high quality, gaps and misassemblies remain due to
                 biological and technical complexities. Large repetitive
                 sequences and complex allelic diversity are the two main
                 drivers of assembly error. Although increasing the length of
                 sequence reads and library fragments can improve assembly,
                 even the longest available reads do not resolve all regions.
                 In order to overcome the issue of allelic diversity, we used
                 genomic DNA from an essentially haploid hydatidiform mole,
                 CHM1. We utilized several resources from this DNA including a
                 set of end-sequenced and indexed BAC clones and 100$\times$
                 Illumina whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequence coverage. We used
                 the WGS sequence and the GRCh37 reference assembly to create
                 an assembly of the CHM1 genome. We subsequently incorporated
                 382 finished BAC clone sequences to generate a draft assembly,
                 CHM1\_1.1 (NCBI AssemblyDB GCA\_000306695.2). Analysis of
                 gene, repetitive element, and segmental duplication content
                 show this assembly to be of excellent quality and contiguity.
                 However, comparison to assembly-independent resources, such as
                 BAC clone end sequences and PacBio long reads, indicate
                 misassembled regions. Most of these regions are enriched for
                 structural variation and segmental duplication, and can be
                 resolved in the future. This publicly available assembly will
                 be integrated into the Genome Reference Consortium curation
                 framework for further improvement, with the ultimate goal
                 being a completely finished gap-free assembly.",

              the clinical interpretation of copy number variation. The
              evidence-based review (EBR) process has been widely used to
              develop standards for medical decision-making and to explore
              complex clinical questions. This approach can be applied to
              genetic tests, such as chromosomal microarrays, in order to
              assist in the clinical interpretation of certain copy number
              variants (CNVs), particularly those that are rare, and guide
              array design for optimal clinical utility. To address these
              issues, the International Standards for Cytogenomic Arrays
              Consortium has established an EBR Work Group charged with
              building a framework to systematically assess the potential
              clinical relevance of CNVs throughout the genome. This group has
              developed a rating system enumerating the evidence supporting or
              refuting dosage sensitivity for individual genes and regions that
              considers the following criteria: number of causative mutations
              reported; patterns of inheritance; consistency of phenotype;
              evidence from large-scale case-control studies; mutational
              mechanisms; data from public genome variation databases; and
              expert consensus opinion. The system is designed to be dynamic in
              nature, with regions being reevaluated periodically to
              incorporate emerging evidence. The evidence collected will be
              displayed within a publically available database, and can be used
              in part to inform clinical laboratory CNV interpretations as well

              continuum from a single base pair insertion/deletion (INDEL) to
              large megabase-scale rearrangements involving insertions,
              deletions, duplications, inversions, or translocations of whole
              chromosomes or chromosome arms. These variants can occur in
              coding or noncoding DNA, they can be inherited or arise
              sporadically in the germline or somatic cells. Many of these
              events are segregating in the population and can be considered
              common alleles while others are new alleles and thus rare events.
              All species studied to date harbor structural variants and these
              may be benign, contributing to phenotypes such as sensory
              perception and immunity, or pathogenic resulting in genomic

              human disease such as autism and intellectual disabilities.
              Because copy number variants are common in normal individuals,
              determining the functional and clinical significance of rare copy
              number variants in patients remains challenging. The adoption of
              whole-genome chromosomal microarray analysis as a first-tier
              diagnostic test for individuals with unexplained developmental
              disabilities provides a unique opportunity to obtain large copy
              number variant datasets generated through routine patient care.
              METHODS:: A consortium of diagnostic laboratories was established
              (the International Standards for Cytogenomic Arrays consortium)
              to share copy number variant and phenotypic data in a central,
              public database. We present the largest copy number variant
              case-control study to date comprising 15,749 International
              Standards for Cytogenomic Arrays cases and 10,118 published
              controls, focusing our initial analysis on recurrent deletions
              and duplications involving 14 copy number variant regions.
              RESULTS:: Compared with controls, 14 deletions and seven
              duplications were significantly overrepresented in cases,
              providing a clinical diagnosis as pathogenic. CONCLUSION:: Given
              the rapid expansion of clinical chromosomal microarray analysis
              testing, very large datasets will be available to determine the
              functional significance of increasingly rare copy number
              variants. This data will provide an evidence-based guide to
              clinicians across many disciplines involved in the diagnosis,
              management, and care of these patients and their families.",

               international workshops and conducted a literature review of 33
               studies, including 21,698 patients tested by CMA. We provide an
               evidence-based summary of clinical cytogenetic testing comparing
               CMA to G-banded karyotyping with respect to technical advantages
               and limitations, diagnostic yield for various types of
               chromosomal aberrations, and issues that affect test
               interpretation. CMA offers a much higher diagnostic yield
               (15\%-20\%) for genetic testing of individuals with unexplained
               DD/ID, ASD, or MCA than a G-banded karyotype ( approximately
               3\%, excluding Down syndrome and other recognizable chromosomal
               syndromes), primarily because of its higher sensitivity for
               submicroscopic deletions and duplications. Truly balanced
               rearrangements and low-level mosaicism are generally not
               detectable by arrays, but these are relatively infrequent causes
               of abnormal phenotypes in this population (<1\%). Available
               evidence strongly supports the use of CMA in place of G-banded
               karyotyping as the first-tier cytogenetic diagnostic test for
               patients with DD/ID, ASD, or MCA. G-banded karyotype analysis
               should be reserved for patients with obvious chromosomal
               syndromes (e.g., Down syndrome), a family history of chromosomal
               rearrangement, or a history of multiple miscarriages.",

              comprehensive understanding of mouse biology is only possible
              with the availability of a finished, high-quality genome
              assembly. The finished clone-based assembly of the mouse strain

              Mb more of novel sequence, compared with the earlier MGSCv3 draft
              genome assembly. In a comprehensive analysis of this revised
              genome sequence, we are now able to define 20,210 protein-coding
              genes, over a thousand more than predicted in the human genome
              (19,042 genes). In addition, we identified 439 long,
              non-protein-coding RNAs with evidence for transcribed orthologs
              in human. We analyzed the complex and repetitive landscape of 267
              Mb of sequence that was missing or misassembled in the previously
              published assembly, and we provide insights into the reasons for
              its resistance to sequencing and assembly by whole-genome shotgun
              approaches. Duplicated regions within newly assembled sequence
              tend to be of more recent ancestry than duplicates in the
              published draft, correcting our initial understanding of recent
              evolution on the mouse lineage. These duplicates appear to be
              largely composed of sequence regions containing transposable
              elements and duplicated protein-coding genes; of these, some may
              be fixed in the mouse population, but at least 40\% of
              segmentally duplicated sequences are copy number variable even
              among laboratory mouse strains. Mouse lineage-specific regions
              contain 3,767 genes drawn mainly from rapidly-changing gene
              families associated with reproductive functions. The finished
              mouse genome assembly, therefore, greatly improves our
              understanding of rodent-specific biology and allows the

              estimates from the whole-genome shotgun sequence assembly.
              However, the architecture of mouse and human genomes differs
              markedly: most mouse duplications are organized into discrete
              clusters of tandem duplications that show depletion of genes and
              transcripts and enrichment of long interspersed nuclear element
              (LINE) and long terminal repeat (LTR) retroposons. We assessed
              copy number variation of the C57BL/6J duplicated regions within
              15 mouse strains previously used for genetic association studies,
              sequencing and the Mouse Phenome Project. We determined that over

              strains show comparable, if not greater, copy number polymorphism

              of human genetic variation, with millions present in the human
              genome. Because only 1\% might be expected to confer more than
              modest individual effects in association studies, the selection
              of predictive candidate variants for complex disease analyses is
              formidable. Technologic advances in SNP discovery and the
              ever-changing annotation of the genome have led to massive
              informational resources that can be difficult to master across
              disciplines. A simplified guide is needed. Although methods for
              evaluating nonsynonymous coding SNPs are known, several other
              publicly available computational tools can be utilized to assess
              polymorphic variants in noncoding regions. As an example, the
              authors applied multiple methods to select SNPs in DNA
              double-strand break repair genes. They chose to evaluate SNPs
              that occurred among a preexisting set of 57 validated assays and
              to justify new assay development for 83 potential SNPs in the
              DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit. Of the 140 SNPs,
              the authors eliminated 119 variants with low or neutral

              used to introduce genes into cells expressing the corresponding
              avian receptor tv-a. This includes the use of
              Replication-Competent Avian sarcoma-leukosis virus (ASLV) long
              terminal repeat (LTR) with Splice acceptor (RCAS) vectors in the

              murine cell lineage studies and cancer biology. Previously,
              cloning of genes into this virus was difficult due to the large
              size of the vector and sparse cloning sites. To overcome some of
              the disadvantages of traditional cloning using the RCASBP-Y
              vector, we have modified the RCASBP-Y to incorporate ``Gateway''
              site-specific recombination cloning of genes into the construct,
              either with or without HA epitope tags. We have found the
              repetitive ``att'' sequences, which are the targets for
              site-specific recombination, do not impair the production of
              infectious viral particles or the expression of the gene of
              interest. This is the first instance of site-specific
              recombination being used to generate retroviral gene constructs.
              These viral constructs will allow for the efficient transfer and
              expression of cDNAs needed for functional genomic analyses.",

              particularly suited for identifying essential genes in
              development either directly or by screening induced mutations
              against a deletion. To apply this approach to the functional
              analysis of mouse chromosome 2, a strategy for the rapid
              generation of nested deletions with Cre recombinase was developed
              and tested. A loxP site was targeted to the Notch1 gene on
              chromosome 2. A targeted line was cotransfected with a second
              loxP site and a plasmid for transient expression of Cre.
              Independent random integrations of the second loxP site onto the
              targeted chromosome in direct repeat orientation created multiple
              nested deletions. By virtue of targeting in an F(1) hybrid
              embryonic stem cell line, F(1)(129S1xCast/Ei), the deletions
              could be verified and rapidly mapped. Ten deletions fell into

              were cytologically normal, but the two largest deletions had
              additional rearrangements. Three deletions, including the largest
              unrearranged deletion, have been transmitted through the germ
              line. Several endpoints also have been cloned by plasmid rescue.
              These experiments illustrate the means to rapidly create and map

              majority of the genes responsible for these disorders have not
              yet been cloned. Exon amplification and EST mapping were
              performed using clones derived from an approximately 1.65-Mb P1
              artificial chromosome contig encompassing the region that
              reportedly harbors the gene mutated in the dominantly inherited
              eye disorder, Best disease. Fifty-eight exons isolated from the
              region were sequenced, resulting in 41.3\% showing weak or no
              similarity to database sequences. Four exons had exact matches
              with human ESTs and 2 exons were highly similar to mouse ESTs.
              The sequence of 1 of these human ESTs was highly similar to that
              of the rat Rabin3 and mouse Pat-12 genes, which potentially
              encode Ras-like GTPase binding proteins. Three exon sequences
              were similar to those of the inner centromere proteins of Gallus
              gallus and Xenopus laevis, which are mitotic phosphoproteins, and
              1 exon sequence had similarity to the epidermal growth
              factor-like repeat from several proteins. High-resolution mapping
              of 34 ESTs binned to the 11q12-q13 region by the Human Transcript

              cosmid from this region that contained both exon-trap and mapped
              EST sequences. PowerBLAST and GRAIL analysis of this cosmid
              sequence identified matches with several other ESTs, the
              previously described FEN1 gene, and a novel evolutionarily
              conserved gene. These experiments identify candidate genes for

              We report here the generation of a human chromosome 5-specific
              radiation hybrid (RH) map that includes 556 markers. Of these
              markers, 132 loci are ordered with a maximum likelihood ratio of

              113 loci were ordered relative to these backbone markers with a
              maximum likelihood ratio of >10:1 but 300 more markers were
              localized based on two-point analysis with the ordered set. On
              average, there are 50 markers in common with the RH map presented

              identification of a liver-specific human protein that is 62\%
              identical to IQGAP1. Like IQGAP1, the novel IQGAP2 protein
              harbors an N-terminal calponin homology motif which functions as
              an F-actin binding domain in members of the spectrin, filamin,
              and fimbrin families. Both IQGAPs also harbor several copies of a
              novel 50- to 55-amino-acid repeat, a single WW domain, and four
              IQ motifs and have 25\% sequence identity with almost the entire
              S. pombe sar1 RasGAP homolog. As predicted by the presence of IQ
              motifs, IQGAP2 binds calmodulin. However, neither full-length nor
              truncated IQGAP2 stimulated the GTPase activity of Ras or its
              close relatives. Instead, IQGAP2 binds Cdc42 and Racl but not

              Rac1, the protein did inhibit both the intrinsic and
              RhoGAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis rates of Cdc42 and Rac1,
              suggesting an alternative mechanism via which IQGAPs might
              modulate signaling by these GTPases. Since IQGAPs harbor a

              amino acid motif of 34 residues that has been identified in a
              variety of proteins; however, no biochemical function has been
              established for it. In a two-hybrid screen for interaction with
              the GAP-related domain of neurofibromin, the product of the NF1
              gene, we have identified two novel human genes encoding proteins
              with TPR motifs. The first, represented by cDNA tpr1, is located
              in chromosome 5q32-33.2. It is ubiquitously expressed as a 1.6-kb
              transcript that encodes three tandem TPR motifs, but is not
              related to any other known gene outside this domain. The second,
              defined by cDNA tpr2, maps to human chromosome 17q11.2-23. It is
              ubiquitously expressed as a 2.2-kb transcript encoding seven TPR
              units. Interestingly, a separate region of the tpr2 cDNA has
              striking similarity to the ``J region'' of the DnaJ family. The
              products of the tpr1 and tpr2 cDNAs interact preferentially with
              a truncated form of the NF1 GAP-related domain via their TPR
              regions, suggesting that they may be targeted to an abnormality
