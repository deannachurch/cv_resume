Modifying friggeri template to update CV and Resume.
Set up makefile to compile both with one command.
  make runs, but output is different from commandline
Bibliography generated by Paperpile

To Do:
[*] update resume tex file with my info.
[*] update cv tex file with my info
[] set up in git
[*] investigate Paperpile API to automatically generate bib file on make, rather
than manually pulling down.
   Doesn't exist
[] investigate- can I programmatically insert publication number?
[*] should I make a separate .cls file for the resume that omits the publication part?
   No: just comment out add publication line in dmc-resume.tex makefile
[*] investigate how to get resume to not print blank second page
  rather unsatisfactory conclusion, but getting rid of the publication block
  and combining into scholarship and service worked OK.
[*] Update presentations when you have a calendar
[*] Update teaching section when you have a calendar
[] sort out adding preprints
